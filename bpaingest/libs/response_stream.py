# # Streaming a `requests` response as a file
# In many applications, you'd like to access a `requests` response as a file-like object, simply having `.read()`, `.seek()`, and `.tell()` as normal. Especially when you only want to *partially* download a file, it'd be extra convenient if you could use a normal file interface for it, loading as needed.
#
# This is a wrapper class for doing that. Only bytes you request will be loaded - see the example in the gist itself.
